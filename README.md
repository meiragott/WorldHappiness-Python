# Global Happiness Analysis Project [Python & Tableau]
Data-driven analysis using Python to examine the impact of economic performance and health on global happiness and well-being.

---

## Introduction

The World Happiness Report 2024 offers an in-depth analysis of global well-being and life satisfaction, based on comprehensive data collected through surveys conducted in over 150 countries. As an analyst, my task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis to derive actionable insights and suggest strategies for improving global happiness.

### Disclaimer

***The World Happiness Report is a real publication that makes its data available online. However, the contents of this project brief have been created for this educational project.***

## Objective

The objective of this project is to use Python to perform data analysis on global happiness data. The aim is to uncover patterns and trends in factors influencing life satisfaction, such as economic performance and health, and present the findings in a Tableau dashboard.

## Context

The analysis will help to understand the factors that contribute to happiness and life satisfaction across different countries. Policymakers, researchers, and the general public can use these insights to inform strategies for improving well-being.

## Key Questions

The analysis aims to address several key questions:
1. What is the relationship between GDP per capita and happiness scores?
2. How does life expectancy influence happiness levels?
3. What regional disparities exist in happiness and related factors?
4. How do various factors like social support, freedom, and generosity impact overall well-being?

## Stakeholders

- **Policymakers**: “We need insights to improve the well-being of our citizens.”
- **Researchers**: “We aim to study the determinants of happiness and their implications on policies.”
- **General Public**: “We want to understand the factors that contribute to happiness and life satisfaction.”

## Data & Tools

### Data Sources

The primary data source is the World Happiness Report 2024, which includes:
- **Global Happiness Data**: Surveys conducted in over 150 countries, covering economic stability, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

### Tools

- **Python**: Used as the primary language for data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: An interactive computing environment for developing and presenting data analyses.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Anaconda**: For managing the Python environment and libraries.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards.
